TensorFlow
==========

The TensorFlow for CPUs [conda environment](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/use-notebook-sessions.htm#conda_understand_environments) is an ecosystem to create state-of-the-art machine learning models. You can use TensorFlow to train and deploy deep neural networks for image recognition, natural language processing, recurrent neural networks, and other machine learning applications. Use the `ads-lite` library to speed up your data science workflow.


There are no tensorflow specific notebooks at this time but you can leverage the capabilities listed above in our tensorflow23_p37_cpu_v1 conda pack.
