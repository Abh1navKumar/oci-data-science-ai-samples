Database Conda Pack 
====================

This [Oracle Database](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/use-notebook-sessions.htm#conda_understand_environments) conda environment enables you to work seamlessly with Oracle Databases using the `ADS Connector`, `SQLAlchemy` and `ipython-sql`. Use a notebook to create ETL jobs, batch transform data, and perform database queries. The ADS Connector provides a uniform interface to connect to databases. The conda includes support for Oracle Database, MySQL and SQLite. The `ipython-sql` magic extension (`%sql` or `%%sql`) allows you to connect to various databases and issue SQL commands directly in a notebook cell. You can build ETL jobs or integrate the results into your Python code. 

The notebooks in this folder are meant to be run in our database_p37_cpu_v1 conda pack.
