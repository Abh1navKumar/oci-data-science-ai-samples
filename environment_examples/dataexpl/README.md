Data Exploration and Manipulation
=================================

The [Data Exploration and Manipulation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/use-notebook-sessions.htm#conda_understand_environments) conda environment contains packages for data exploration, manipulation, and visualization.  Included within this conda environment are `pandas`, `numpy`, and `dask` to explore and transform your datasets, and `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, and `bokeh` to construct visualizations. This environment also includes the \"lite\" distribution of Oracle Accelerated Data Science (`ADS`) library, which offers a variety of useful data access, profiling, and transformation features. 


The notebooks in this folder are meant to be run in our dataexpl_p37_cpu_v1 conda pack.
