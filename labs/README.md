## Table of Examples 

* [Employee Attrition](./employee-attrition/) 
  This example is a modified version of the employee attrition notebook that is available in the OCI Data Science Notebook Session environment. The notebook provides an end-to-end workflow to build, ttrain, deploy, and invoke a machine learning model used to predict employee attrition. 

* [Model Deployment](./model-deploy/) 
  This example highlights the deployment of a sklearn random forest model trained on synthetic data. The model is deployed programmatically with the OCI Python SDK and invoked with the same SDK.

* [Speech Commands](./speech-commands)
  In this example you use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify speech commands. The notebooks show how you can train a model with Keras and deploy the model using OCI Data Science Model Deployment. 

* [X-ray Diagnostics](./xray-diagnostics)
  The purpose of this example is to train a model that detects the presence of pneumonia in x-ray images of the chest area. The example showcases and end-to-end workflow for model building, training, and deployment.
