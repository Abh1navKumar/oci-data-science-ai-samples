TensorFlow Conda Environment Family
===================================

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a machine learning platform that is focused on deep neural networks. Use this ecosystem to create state-of-the-art machine learning models and the [TensorFlow conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-tensor-fam.htm) has support for both CPUs and GPUs. This family of conda environments allows you to train and deploy deep neural networks for image recognition, natural language processing, recurrent neural networks, and other machine learning applications.

There are no TensorFlow-specific notebooks for this family of conda environments.
