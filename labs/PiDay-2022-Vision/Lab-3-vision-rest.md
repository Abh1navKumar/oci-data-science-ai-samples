# Lab 3: Access OCI Vision with REST APIs

## Introduction

In this lab session, we will show you how to access OCI Vision using POSTMAN.

Postman is a GUI-based REST API invocation tool that is very popular among developers.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 10 minutes

### Objectives:
* Learn how to access Vision Service through REST APIs.

### Prerequisites:
* Basic knowledge of REST API calls.
* Postman GUI in your local setup. If you don't have POSTMAN, please download it from [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

## **TASK 1:** Setting Up Postman for OCI REST APIs
We have put together a Postman Collection and Environment to help you quickly get started with calling the Vision REST APIs.

1. Import the Vision Collection into Postman

Download the [Vision API Collection](https://www.postman.com/oracledevs/workspace/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-rest-apis/overview) and import the Collection into Postman using the 'Import' button at the top.
   
1. Import the OCI Credentials Environment into Postman

Download the [OCI Credentials Environment](https://www.postman.com/oracledevs/workspace/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-rest-apis/environment/29850-eab82db8-e9a1-4200-9f39-de10b4a0f371) and import the Environment into Postman using the 'Import' button at the top.

Make sure to set OCI Credentials as the active environment.

1. Set the Variables
Open and edit the newly imported environment (OCI Credentials), and set the variables tenancy_ocid, user_ocid, fingerprint, private_key, region, and compartment_ocid.

Make sure to set both Initial Value and Current Value of the variables (set both as the same value).

Click the Save button to commit your changes to the environment.
