    "* Provides data scientists with a collaborative, project-driven workspace.\n",
    "* Enables self-service access to infrastructure for data science workloads.\n",
    "* Includes Python-centric tools, libraries, and packages developed by the open-source community and the [Oracle Accelerated Data Science Library](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/ads-sdk/latest/index.html), which supports the end-to-end lifecycle of predictive models:\n",

    "This **[Oracle Database](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/use-notebook-sessions.htm#conda_understand_environments)** conda environment enables you to work seamlessly with Oracle Databases using the `ADS Connector`, `SQLAlchemy` and `ipython-sql`. Use a notebook to create ETL jobs, batch transform data, and perform database queries. The ADS Connector provides a uniform interface to connect to databases. The conda includes support for Oracle Database, MySQL and SQLite. The `ipython-sql` magic extension (`%sql` or `%%sql`) allows you to connect to various databases and issue SQL commands directly in a notebook cell. You can build ETL jobs or integrate the results into your Python code. The examples in this notebook emphasize how to connect to an Oracle Database and access data.\n",
