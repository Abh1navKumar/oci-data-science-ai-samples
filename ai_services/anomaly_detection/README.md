##Anomaly Detection

[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Anomaly Detection](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/anomaly-detection/) is an AI service that enables developers to more easily build business-specific anomaly detection models that flag critical incidents, resulting in faster time to detection and resolution. Specialized APIs and automated model selection simplify training and deploying anomaly detection models to applications and operationsâ€”all without data science expertise.

<b>Ready-to-go results</b>

OCI Anomaly Detection outputs include identified anomalies, ML model-based estimated values, and anomaly scores. Developers use these results to assess the severity of identified anomalies and automate business workflows to address them immediately.

<b>Easy to integrate and deploy</b>

OCI Anomaly Detection is a multitenant service over public REST APIs. Developers can deploy a scalable anomaly detection service easily without in-house data science and ML support, all with the lowest cost platform for data networking, storage, and egress.

<b>Scalability on demand</b>

OCI Anomaly Detection automatically scales for training and detection needs across all data sources and loads. Developers can now focus on creating applications and solutions to achieve their business goals, without worrying about the infrastructure.
