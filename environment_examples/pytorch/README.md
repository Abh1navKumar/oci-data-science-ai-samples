PyTorch 
=======

The PyTorch for CPUs [conda environment](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/data-science/using/use-notebook-sessions.htm#conda_understand_environments) is designed for machine learning activities with a focus on applications in computer vision and natural language processing. It provides high-level features for tensor computing and deep neural networks.  This environment also includes acceleration support on Intel's CPUs with the use of `daal4py`. This library enhances `scikit-learn` algorithms by using Intel(R) `oneAPI` Data Analytics library. Use ads-lite to speed up your data science workflow with tools that automate common tasks.

The notebooks in this folder are meant to be run in our PyTorch conda pack.
