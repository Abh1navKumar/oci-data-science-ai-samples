ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) 
==================================

ONNX is an open-source model format for machine learning and deep learning models. It allows you to save a model from different ML libraries into a single, portable format that is independent of the training library. It allows for data scientists to persist their models in a single ONNX model format. This is particularly useful if you manage persisted models coming from a variety of frameworks. ONNX builds a computational graph representation of the machine learning model. This graph is optimized at runtime to make rapid model predictions.
