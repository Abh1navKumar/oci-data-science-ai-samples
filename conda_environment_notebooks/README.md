Conda Environment Notebooks
===========================


The [OCI Data Science service](https://www.oracle.com/data-science/cloud-infrastructure-data-science.html) uses [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) to manage the available libraries that a notebook can use. OCI The Data Science service [provides a number of conda environments](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda_understand_environments.htm) designed to give you the best in class libraries for common data science tasks. A family can consist of one or more conda environments. Each family of conda environments has notebooks that demonstrate how to perform different data science tasks. This section is organized around these conda environment families and provides the notebooks that you need to get you started quickly.

# Conda Environment Families

* data_exploration_and_manipulation: The [Data Exploration and Manipulation conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-dem-fam.htm) gives you the tools that you need to perform exploratory data analysis and develop a deeper understanding of the data that you are working with.
* natural_language_processing: The [Natural Language Processing conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-dem-fam.htm) provides the libraries to perform cutting edge NLP tasks.
* onnx: [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) is a standard format to represent machine learning models. It is also the preferred format for storing models in the OCI Data Science service. The [ONNX conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-onnx-fam.htm) enables you to work with ONNX files.
* oracle_database: The [Oracle Database conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-database-fam.htm) is focused on the tools that are needed it interact with databases in general. However, there is an emphasis on using the Oracle Autonomous Databases.
* pypgx: [PyPGX](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/F41824_01/latest/) is a graph toolkit based on the [Parallel Graph AnalytiX (PGX](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56133_01/latest/index.html) libraries. The [PyPGX conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-pypgx-fam.htm) provides a graph query language [(PGQL)](https://pgql-lang.org/spec/1.3/), optimized analytics algorithms, and graph machine learning tools.
* pyspark: The [PySpark conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-pyspark-fam.htm) allows you to create and run [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) operations within the notebook session. It is also a great create and debug PySpark application before submitting them to the [OCI Data Flow service](https://www.oracle.com/big-data/data-flow/) which is OCI's Spark service.
* pytorch: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a machine learning library that is used in applications such as NLP, computer vision, and much more. The [PyTorch conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-pytorch-fam.htm) supports CPU and GPU versions.
* rapids: [RAPIDS](https://developer.nvidia.com/rapids) is a GPU-only library that is designed for data science workflows. The [RAPIDS conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-rapids-fam.htm) enables you to make the most out of OCIs NVIDIA GPU based computing.
* tensorflow: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a machine learning platform that is focused on deep neural networks. The [TensorFlow conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-tensor-fam.htm) has support for CPU and GPU.
