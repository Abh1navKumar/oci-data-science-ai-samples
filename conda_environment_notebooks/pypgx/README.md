PyPGX Conda Environment Family
=============================

[PyPGX (Python Parallel Graph AnalytiX)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/F41824_01/latest/) is a graph toolkit based on the [Parallel Graph AnalytiX (PGX](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56133_01/latest/index.html) libraries. The [PyPGX conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-pypgx-fam.htm) provides a graph query language [(PGQL)](https://pgql-lang.org/spec/1.3/), optimized analytics algorithms, and graph machine learning tools. Graph analysis lets you reveal latent information that is not directly apparent from fields in your data but is encoded as direct and indirect relationships between elements of your data. This connectivity-related information is not obvious to the naked eye but can have tremendous value after it is uncovered. Parallel Graph AnalytiX (PGX) is a toolkit for graph analysis and supports both efficient graph algorithms and fast SQL-like graph pattern matching queries

The notebooks in this folder are meant to be run in the [PyPGX conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-pypgx-fam.htm) conda environments.

# Notebook Descriptions

* `pypgx_algorithms.ipynb`: PyPGX provides a machine learning library that supports the following (graph-empowered) machine learning algorithms, [DeepWalk](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56133_01/latest/prog-guides/mllib/deepwalk.html) (Vertex embeddings), [SupervisedGraphWise](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56133_01/latest/prog-guides/mllib/supervisedgraphwise.html) (Vertex embeddings and classification), [UnsupervisedGraphWise](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56133_01/latest/prog-guides/mllib/unsupervisedgraphwise.html) (Vertex embeddings), and [Pg2vec](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56133_01/latest/prog-guides/mllib/pg2vec.html) (Graph embeddings). In this notebook, you use the scikit-learn diabetes dataset to build a graph and PGQL is demonstrated.
* `pypgx_graph_ml.ipynb`: In this notebook, you use the scikit-learn diabetes dataset to build a graph machine learning models. Two models will be demonstrated, a [Personalize PageRank](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56133_01/2.5.0/reference/algorithms/pagerank.html) and [DeepWalk](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E56133_01/19.1.0/tutorials/mllib/deepwalk.html) model.
* `pypgx_pgql.ipynb`: [Property Graph Query Language (PGQL](https://pgql-lang.org/spec/latest/) is an SQL-based query language for the property graph data model that allows you to specify high-level graph patterns that are matched against vertices and edges in a graph. PGQL has support for grouping (GROUP BY), aggregation (`MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `SUM`), sorting (`ORDER BY`), and many other familiar SQL constructs. Furthermore, PGQL has powerful regular expression constructs for graph reachability (transitive closure), shortest pathfinding, and cheapest pathfinding. In this notebook, you use the scikit-learn diabetes dataset to build a graph, and PGQL is demonstrated.
