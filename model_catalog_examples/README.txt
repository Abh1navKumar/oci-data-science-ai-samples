## Model Catalog Examples

In this directory we have several examples of runtime.yaml and score.py files that can be used to deploy models. There is a wide range of kinds of models including NLP, PyTorch, XGBoost and LighGBM.

We also have [example notebooks](./notebook_examples/) which serve as tutorials to prepare and save different model artifacts and then deploy them as well.
