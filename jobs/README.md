# Oracle Data Science Service Jobs

This project contains samples that demonstrate usage of Oracle Data Science Service Jobs.

Oracle Data Science Service Jobs enables you to define and run a repeatable task on a fully managed infrastructure. The service enables custom tasks, as you can apply any use case you may have such as data preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, batch inference, etc.

Using jobs, you can:

- Run Machine Learning or Data Science tasks outside of your notebooks (JupyterLab)
- Operationalize discrete data science and machine learning tasks as reusable executable operation
- Automate your typical MLOps or CI/CD Process
- Execute batches or workloads triggered by events or actions
- Batch Inference, Mini-Batch or Distributed Batch Jobs


## Samples

The job sample section contains a folder for each programing langugage we currently provide samples. Every language folder will have two additional folders: 

- `sdk` showing how to use the OCI SDK Jobs API 
- `samples` actual code samples you could run as a Job.
