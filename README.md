Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science and AI services Examples  
=================================================================

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science product management team is maintaining a series of demos, tutorials, and code examples highlighting the different features of both [OCI Data Science](https://www.oracle.com/data-science/cloud-infrastructure-data-science.html) and AI services. 

Each directory in this repo corresponds to a different demo/lab and contains its own separate README file giving you instructions on how to run the code examples. 

## Table of Examples 

* [labs](./labs/) 
  In this directory we have 4 different examples to do things like end-to-end build, train, deploy and invoke a machine learning model using OCI Data Science services.
* [ads_v_2_2_0](./ads_v_2_2_0/)
  This directory has all of our generic ADS notebook examples. Here, for example, you can find a notebook about vault connection and model deployment.
* [environment_examples](./environment_examples/)
  This directory has subdirectories for the different conda environments offered. Within each subdirectory you will find notebook examples on that topic.
* [model_deployment_examples](./model_deployment_examples/)
  Here we have several different examples of model deployments, we have offered sample runtime.yaml and score.py files on several different topics.

## Documentation 

There are several ways you can access OCI Data Science documentation:
