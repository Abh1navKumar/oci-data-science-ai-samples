ONNX Conda Environment Family
=============================

[ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)](https://onnx.ai/) is a standard format to represent machine learning models. It is also the preferred format for storing models in the OCI Data Science service. The [ONNX conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-onnx-fam.htm) enables you to work with ONNX files and enables you to save a model from different machine learning libraries into a single, portable format that is independent of the training library. This is particularly useful if you manage persisted models coming from a variety of frameworks. ONNX builds a computational graph representation of the machine learning model. This graph is optimized at runtime to make rapid model predictions.


The notebooks in this folder are meant to be run in the [ONNX conda environment family](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/conda-onnx-fam.htm) conda environments.
