    "\n",
    "* Provides data scientists with a collaborative, project-driven workspace.\n",
    "* Enables self-service access to infrastructure for data science workloads.\n",
    "* Includes Python-centric tools, libraries, and packages developed by the open-source community and the [Oracle Accelerated Data Science Library](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/tools/ads-sdk/latest/index.html), which supports the end-to-end lifecycle of predictive models including:\n",
